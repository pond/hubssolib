            If you are sure you want to delete your account, please use the
            button below to confirm the action. Once deleted your account
            cannot be recovered, except by creating a new account from scratch.

            <p />
            <%= button_to 'Yes, really delete my account!', :controller => 'account', :action => 'delete_confirm' %>

            <p />
            If you don't want to do this, you can
            <%= link_to 'go back to the control panel', :controller => 'tasks', :action => 'index' %>
            instead.
