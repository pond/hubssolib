<h1>Change details</h1>

<p>
  A <%= INSTITUTION_NAME_LONG %> web site account doesn't contain much information. It's really
  just a way to make sure that things contributed to the site come from
  real people, rather than advertisers.
</p>

<p>
  All personal details stored in your account can be edited below, except for
  your e-mail address. To change address, either <b>contact
  <%= INSTITUTION_NAME_LONG %> at <%= mail_to(INSTITUTION_NAME_EMAIL) %></b>
  or, if you want to handle things yourself, delete your old account and create
  a new one. This is required so that the proper account activation process
  is followed for any new e-mail address.
