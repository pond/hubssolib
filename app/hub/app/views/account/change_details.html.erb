        A <%= INSTITUTION_NAME_LONG %> web site account doesn't contain much information. It's really
        just a way to make sure that things contributed to the site come from
        real people, rather than advertisers.

        <p />
        All personal details stored in your account can be edited below, except for
        your e-mail address. To change address, you must delete your old account and
        create a new one. This is required so that the proper account activation
        process is followed for any new e-mail address.

        <p />
        <%= render "shared/error_messages", :target => @user %>

        <%= form_tag do %>
          <p />
          <table class="list" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" border="1" align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff">
            <tr>
              <th bgcolor="#eeeeee" align="left"><label for="real_name">Real name</label></th>
              <td><%= text_field_tag 'real_name', @real_name, :size => 40, :maxlength => 128 %></td>
            </tr>
          </table>

          <p align="center" />
          <%= submit_tag('Update') %>
        <% end %>

        <p />
        If you don't want to do this, you can
        <%= link_to 'go back to the control panel', :controller => 'tasks', :action => 'index' %>
        instead.
